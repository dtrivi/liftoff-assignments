# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Whether you’re a high school ballplayer or a rec league regular, it’d be helpful (or just fun) to have an application that allows you to quickly track your in-game (and update your season-long) stats. My app will do that. I’ve played countless softball games over the past 10 years and I’ve tried to keep track of my stats, but there’s never enough time to jot down the results of each at-bat in a notes app or mobile excel sheet during the game. My app will allow you to create an account and update your stats throughout the game by simply selecting relevant checkboxes and logging an at-bat.

### Features
User Login: 
    Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the applications. Each user will have a history of their stats stored for them by creating an account. Their profile will essentially be a player card.

Log an At-Bat: 
    The main feature will enable a user to run to the bench after an at-bat, pull up the app, select ‘Log an AB’, then quickly select the results of their at-bat by selecting checkboxes that could apply. For example, if they hit a double and drove in a run, and then later scored, the user would select ‘2B’ (for double), ‘RBI’ (for a run batted in), and ‘R’ (for a run scored). They’ll log the at-bat and their stats - or data - will be updated for them to be viewed on their profile.

Weather Update: 
    In an effort to house all relevant information related to a user’s league, the app will provide a forecast for a player’s scheduled game. This should only require that a player provide the zip code of the field they play on for their league.

Sharing Stats: 
    As my “nice to have” feature, I’d love to include an option to share the result of a user’s game with their social networks. Once the user’s game is over, they can share a snapshot of their performance with friends.

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf
React

### What I'll Have to Learn
React - I’ve decided to use this library because I’m not familiar with it. I’m also hoping to pull in weather data using a public API, which I remember discussing in class but I don’t believe I ever had to build it into a project.
